How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Using diff helped to identify the changes that were made to the two files
However, I still needed to read through the changes to find out which line contained the error.
It would be helpful if the editor could find syntax or spelling errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I wouldn't need to save different copies of the files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Granular changes can be more accurately tracked and logged and logically grouped.
Users could forget to commit changes
Auto saved changes would contain multiple changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will show the commit id's for each change along with the notes regarding the changes.
git diff will show the details of the changes between 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always go back and pinpoint when the changes were made and revert back to the earlier code if needed.
