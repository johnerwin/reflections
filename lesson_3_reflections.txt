When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When multiple people are accessing the repository.
  When working from more than one PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If changes have been made on the local repository you would want to make sure that the branch has the correct changes commmitted.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are only performed within GitHub and allow copies of repositories to be made from one user to another without pulling down to a local PC first.
	Clones are made on a local PC and can be performed via local repositories or from GitHub
	Branches are strictly local and are different versions that are made within a local repository
